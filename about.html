            <h3>Our Values</h3>
            <h3>The Lobster Story</h3>
            <div class="story">
                <p>The Lobster Slipper was basically one of those playful ideas-you know, just to see it could be done-and to 
                    have fun with everyday footwear. We wanted to design something that wasn't a novelty item per se but a product
                     that could actually be used and enjoyed. Lobsters, with their signature claws and fire engine red color, 
                     seemed like the perfect inspiration-quirky, attention-grabbing, and tied in with the spirit of coastal life.
                    Initial design concepts took the form of raw sketches, which hugely exaggerated the iconic shape of lobster 
                    claws in an attempt to make each slipper look as life-like as possible, yet still comfortable to wear. The goal 
                    was finding that delicate balance between bold aesthetics and practicality, such that these slippers could 
                    transition from lounging at home to walks along the beach in comfort. Coming from the designers who love the marine, 
                    and even testers, with a great sense of humor, this concept has been fine-tuned to what it is today: an out-of-the-ordinary 
                    slipper, fun and functional.
                    
                    By reimagining footwear through the prism of playfulness in marine themes, lobster slippers became something more than 
                    just a product-they started off a way to show one's individuality and put smiles on people's faces while still keeping 
                    comfortable and protected outdoors.</p>
